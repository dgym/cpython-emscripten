# Printing from Python to the browser console

This example compiles a Python C extension into a DLL that can be imported at runtime.

# Building

Run ```make```.

# Running

Run ```make serve``` to start a web server on local port 8062 (this requires
Python) and then visit the test page
[http://localhost:8062/](http://localhost:8062/).

# The root filesystem

This example includes a minimal root filesystem for Python instead of the full
one used in example 1. This is to show how small an application could be.
The root folder could be replaced with example 1's and rebuilt for a batteries
included experience.

The list of modules was generated by starting off with a full root folder
and then running:

```pyexec("import sys ; print('\\n'.join(m.__file__
for m in sys.modules.values() if hasattr(m, '__file__')))")```
